         I am currently pursuing a Pre-Business major at the University of California, Riverside, where I am building a foundation in business principles while cultivating skills in leadership, communication, and community engagement. I graduated from KIPP King Collegiate High School in June 2024, where I gained early exposure to leadership, collaboration, and academic rigor, all of which have helped shape my career goals and personal development.

My professional experience began in high school and has helped me develop a strong work ethic and a customer-first mindset. At Chick-fil-A, where I worked from April 2023 to August 2024, I served as a Front of House team member. In this role, I was responsible for taking customer orders, maintaining cleanliness in the dining area, assembling and bagging orders, and preparing frozen desserts. I also played a key part in ensuring accuracy for mobile and in-store orders, which required attention to detail and strong communication. My time at Chick-fil-A taught me how to thrive in a fast-paced environment while delivering high-quality service with professionalism and consistency.

Before that, I worked at Richardson Vending from July 2021 to June 2022 as a Stocker. In this role, I was responsible for organizing and restocking vending machine items across multiple locations. I ensured that each machine was clean, well-stocked, and properly maintained, including the removal of expired or damaged items. This job required accountability and time management, as I often worked independently to meet daily stocking goals.<br><br>

        In addition to work experience, Iâ€™ve taken on several leadership roles that reflect my commitment to building community and empowering others. From August 2023 to June 2024, I served on the Student Honor Council at KIPP King Collegiate. I helped create student agreements and mediate peer conflicts, promoting a respectful and supportive campus culture. I also served as Co-Captain of the KKC Spirit Squad from 2021 to 2023, leading cheer practices and coordinating performances for school events. I designed cheers, mentored teammates, and organized team-building activities to strengthen our sense of unity and school spirit.

I was also an active member and designer for B.L.O.C. (Black Leaders on Campus), a student-led group that created safe and inclusive spaces for Black students. My responsibilities included organizing cultural events, such as discussion circles, movie nights, and social gatherings. I also designed digital promotional materials, including flyers and social media graphics, to enhance event visibility and engagement.<br><br>

        In November 2024, I volunteered with the UCR Arts Department during the Encuentro de Musica OaxaqueÃ±as event. I assisted with event setup, visitor check-in, and logistics support, gaining exposure to cultural arts programming and event coordination.

Through each of these experiences, Iâ€™ve developed key skills in leadership, time management, problem-solving, and interpersonal communication. My long-term goal is to build a career in the business worldâ€”potentially as a financial advisorâ€”where I can use these skills to help others achieve financial clarity and success.
